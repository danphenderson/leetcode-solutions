Introduction
------------

As a software developer and problem-solving enthusiast, I created this repository to track and share my progress on LeetCode. Each solution is accompanied by a detailed explanation of my initial thought process, the approach taken, the worst-case complexities involved, and, of course, the code itself.

Usage
-----
You will find Markdown files, each corresponding to a specific LeetCode problem. The files are named after the problem titles for easy navigation.

Contribution
------------

While this is a personal repository, suggestions and feedback are always welcome! If you have any ideas on how to improve a solution or want to suggest alternative approaches, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
